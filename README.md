# TextRighter
##### The righter way to edit text
---

A simple text editor designed for simple people. 
Meant for learning, usability, customizability, and fun. 
The goal being an editor I can use daily (and hopefully others too).
I plan to work on this casually and will glady accept PRs.

## Usage

`bash
git clone https://github.com/benlloyd50/textright
cd textright 
cargo run [file name]
`


## Roadmap

[ ] Config
    - [ ] Themes
    - [ ] General Settings
    - [ ] Status Bar
    - [ ] Keybindings

[ ] Modal Editing

[ ] Live updates on file (VS-code style)
